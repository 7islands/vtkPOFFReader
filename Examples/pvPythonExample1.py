# A simple ParaView-Python scripting example for use with vtkPOpenFOAMReader.
#
# Synopsis: Set current directory to the case directory and animate
#   through all available time steps by coloring the mesh with the
#   specified field.
#
# Usage: pvPythonExample1.py fieldName caseType
#   where
#     fieldName: name of the field used for color mapping
#     caseType: 0 = decomposed case (appended), 1 = reconstructed case,
#               2 = decomposed case (multiblock)
# Ex.:
#   cd run/tutorials/multiphase/interFoam/laminar/damBreakFine
#   pvPythonExample1.py alpha1 0

# Create and setup the reader

# Unlike vtkPythonExample1.py, a try-except clause is not necessary to
# access the fallback builtin reader that comes with ParaView 3.7-cvs,
# since vtkPOFFDevReader (a plugin version) and the builtin version
# shares a common proxy name of OpenFOAMReader. If both the plugin and
# the builtin versions are present in a single ParaView installation,
# the plugin version is used by ParaView's design.

# FileName: Note that the file name should be specified at the reader
# instantiation. As To the file name, basically only the path part of
# the given file name string matters to the reader, i.e.:
#  * The specified file does _not_ have to really exist, nor does its
#    name have to end with the '.foam' extension. Thus the file name
#    can even be a whitespace (as shown in this example).
#  * If no prepending path is present in the given string (as shown in
#    this example), the current directory is regarded as the case
#    directory.
